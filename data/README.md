# Data/Input Directory

Make sure to place your example inputs as well as your actual inputs in this directory.

This should typically follow the following structure:

    ./day01/example.txt
    ./day01/input.txt
    ./day02/example.txt
    ./day02/input.txt

Some days might have different examples, in which case the files would use a trailing number:

    ./day03/example1.txt
    ./day03/example2.txt
    ./day03/input.txt
